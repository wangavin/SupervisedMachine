# SupervisedMachine

Welcome to the SupervisedMachine project! This project focuses on training and evaluating a model to assess loan risk. 
By analyzing historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company, we aim to develop a model that can determine the creditworthiness of borrowers.

### Summary of Analysis
The primary objective of this analysis is to construct a model capable of predicting the creditworthiness of borrowers using data from a lending service 
company. The model's purpose is to differentiate between low-risk and high-risk loans, enabling the company to minimize approval costs by rejecting 
high-risk loans while maximizing profits from approving healthy loans.

The dataset used in this model contains historical loans and important financial variables associated with the borrowers' financial 
profiles and loan details. These variables, such as the loan amount, interest rate, borrower's income, number of accounts, and total debt, 
provide insights into whether an individual is likely to repay their loan. By leveraging machine learning techniques and methodologies, 
we can effectively address the credit balance limitations present in the data.

The dataset consists of 77,536 loans, with 75,036 classified as healthy loans and 2,500 as high-risk loans. This balance in the data is typical since 
most individuals tend to meet their financial obligations. The application of machine learning algorithms and methodologies enables our company staff 
to effectively handle the credit balance limitations inherent in the data.

### Project result
Based on the results obtained, I am confident that utilizing oversampled data leads to significant improvements in the Logistic Regression model's 
performance. The model achieved a balanced accuracy score of approximately 0.99, indicating its high proficiency in accurately identifying high-risk 
loans with a high recall accuracy, thus minimizing false negatives.
